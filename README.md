## Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs a data analysis on student performance metrics. The goal is to:

- Explore which features (e.g., study time, past failures, demographic characteristics) relate most strongly to student success.
- Build predictive models to forecast student performance (grades, pass/fail, etc.).
- Provide actionable insights that could help educators or administrators.

---

## Problem Statement

Understanding what factors contribute to student performance can help in identifying the students who need additional support and designing interventions. This project tries to answer:

- Which factors (study habits, previous performance, personal attributes) are most predictive of student success?  
- Can we reliably predict whether a student will perform well or poorly?  
- What are key levers (features) that can be used to improve performance?

## Data

- **Source**: (Mention where you got the data from — a CSV, UCI, Kaggle, or school data)  
- **Features**: Describe the key features you used (for example, demographic data, academic history, study time, number of failures)  
- **Preprocessing**: Briefly mention if you handled missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling, etc.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the notebook, I performed:

- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, distribution)  
- Data visualizations (histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmaps)  
- Feature engineering, if any (e.g., combining related features, generating new ones)  
- Outlier detection and treatment

---

## Modeling

I tried different predictive models, for example:

- **Baseline model** (maybe linear regression or logistic regression)  
- **Tree-based models** (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Tree)  
- **Cross-validation** to validate model performance  
- Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE, or whichever is relevant)

---

## Results & Insights

- Key findings from the EDA  
- Which features turned out to be most important for prediction  
- Performance of different models (which model performed best and why)  
- Interpretation: what these insights mean in a real-world / educational context
